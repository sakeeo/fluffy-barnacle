YouTube Comment Scraper
A Python script to scrape comments (and optionally replies) from a YouTube video using the YouTube Data API v3. The script performs sentiment analysis on comments using VADER and generates a bar chart visualization of sentiment distribution. Results are saved as a CSV file, and visualizations (if enabled) are saved as PNG files, all stored in a dedicated output folder.
Features

Scrape main comments and optionally replies from a YouTube video.
Filter comments by search terms (optional).
Perform sentiment analysis (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using VADER.
Generate a bar chart of sentiment distribution (optional).
Save results in a CSV file and visualization in a PNG file within a named output folder.
Load API key securely from a .env file.
User-defined output file naming with a custom title or video ID.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed.
YouTube Data API Key:
Create a project in Google Cloud Console.
Enable YouTube Data API v3.
Generate an API key in the Credentials section.

Required Python Libraries:google-api-python-client

Installation

Clone or Download the Repository (if using Git):
git clone <repository-url>
cd youtube_comment_scraper

Or download the script files manually to a folder (e.g., D:\DEVELOPMENT\PYTHON\tools\youtube_comment_scraper).

Install Dependencies:Run the following command to install required libraries:
pip install google-api-python-client pandas vaderSentiment matplotlib python-dotenv

Set Up the .env File:

Create a file named .env in the project directory.
Add your YouTube API key:YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

Replace your_actual_api_key_here with your API key.
Ensure .env is not shared publicly (itâ€™s ignored by .gitignore).

Usage

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd D:\DEVELOPMENT\PYTHON\tools\youtube_comment_scraper

Run the Script:
python main.py

Provide Inputs:

YouTube Video URL: Enter the URL of the video (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
Maximum Number of Comments and Replies: Enter the maximum number to scrape (e.g., 50).
Search Terms (optional): Enter keywords to filter comments (e.g., great) or press Enter to skip.
Output File Title (optional): Enter a title for the output folder and files (e.g., rick_astley_review) or press Enter to use the video ID.
Fetch Comment Replies: Enter y to include replies, or N (or Enter) for main comments only.
Generate Sentiment Visualization: Enter y to generate a bar chart, or N (or Enter) to skip.

Output:

A folder (e.g., output_rick_astley_review) will be created in the project directory, containing:
youtube_comments_rick_astley_review.csv: Comments, replies (if enabled), and sentiment analysis.
sentiment_distribution_rick_astley_review.png (if visualization is enabled): Bar chart of sentiment distribution.

Example CSV content:Type,Comment,Author,Published At,Like Count,Sentiment,Sentiment Score

Notes

API Quota: Each commentThreads.list request consumes 1 unit of the YouTube Data API quota (default 10,000 units/day). Fetching replies increases quota usage. Check quota in Google Cloud Console if errors occur.
Sentiment Analysis: VADER is optimized for English. For Indonesian comments, consider using a model like IndoBERT.
Security: Do not share your .env file or API key. The .gitignore file ensures .env is not uploaded to Git.
Output Files: Use unique titles to avoid overwriting existing output folders.
Dependencies: Ensure all libraries are installed to avoid ModuleNotFoundError.

Troubleshooting

IndentationError:
Open main.py in an editor (e.g., VS Code) and ensure all indentation uses 4 spaces (not tabs).
Enable "Show Whitespace" to verify.

YOUTUBE_API_KEY not found:
Ensure .env exists in the project directory with YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key.
Check for typos or extra spaces in .env.

API Errors:
Verify the API key is valid and YouTube Data API v3 is enabled.
Check for quota exhaustion in Google Cloud Console.

Visualization Issues:
Ensure matplotlib is installed (pip install matplotlib).
Check write permissions in the project directory.
